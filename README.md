# Project-Aries
Project-Aries is my personal dream project about a cryptocurrency helping value for creators. It will have a different blockchain i.e. it will not be forks of existing cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. The main objective of Project-Aries is to create value for content creators, in the day and age where there primary income is limited to Ad Revenue and Sponsorships.

## What have I done here?
In this project, I have simply created a sample blockchain network based on my understanding of blockchain gained from various sources. To test, it is currently written in Javascript, which is one the fastest ways I can put my theory into practical use.

I have currently used Proof of Work in this sample Blockchain, but I am aware that Proof Of Work is now not so reliable as a Proof of Stake concept. As I learn more and more, I will update this project.

This is a simple project, based on my understanding of Object Oriented Programming studied in my CS Class in college.

## Why now?
I had my idea for a new cryptocurrency for years now, but sadly, I used to always think that the windows of opportunity has passed.

But, one day, I got back the inspiration to work on my idea from a youtube video(Of all places) on how the window of opportunity never closes. For e.g. Ford was the first company to mass-produce cars but, has not been a market leader for a while now. Many other companies, such as german carmakers post WW2 and EV companies like Tesla today, crossing the $1 trillion valuation mark as I write, are in the front.

So, I thought to myself that even though Bitcoin and Ethereum are dominating today, there is absolutely not certainity that they will continue to dominate in the near future, there will always be one person who will come up with an better idea to race past them in value.

## How to run

Currently, this sample blockchain will run on nodejs and uses crypto.js as a dependency.
