# JS-Blockchain

## What have I done here?
In this project, I have simply created a sample blockchain network based on my understanding of blockchain gained from various sources. To test, it is currently written in Javascript, which is one the fastest ways I can put my theory into practical use.

I have currently used Proof of Work in this sample Blockchain, but I am aware that Proof Of Work is now not so reliable as a Proof of Stake concept. As I learn more and more, I will update this project.

This is a simple project, based on my understanding of Object Oriented Programming studied in my CS Class in college.

## ðŸš€ About Me
What to say... I have always been very fond of technology. I started programming at age 10-11 and 
by age 13, was freelancing by  converting photoshop web designs
to html frontend. 

Then, at age 14, I started learning Java because at the time, I got my first android smartphone
and I wanted to create a camera app that was significantly better 
than the stock app.(Most low end phones had shitty software at the time.)
I created a camera app using camera2 api.

This helped me into landing my first internship at a local 
startup that was creating a web browser to be popular in India.

I never liked traditional form of education, as I believed more in
self-learning, a thing that I like most, even today.

All of my hours of coding, and couple of programming languages later,
I got into Illinois Tech on a very comfortable scholarship. As of 21' I'm
a freshman with couple of LOAs trying to get my feet steady in a new country
with much different culture that I'm accustomed to.

I've always loved creator platforms like Youtube and Instagram(but not Tik-Tok)
, but I'm always midly infuriated by the fact that their main source of revenue
is ad-sense, which in turn degrades the end viewer experience. 

And I want to be the one to change that by using my cryptocurrency to provide
value to these creators.
