# BlockchainJS

## Overview
BlockchainJS is a project where I demonstrate my knowledge of blockchain in JavaScript. The project implements a basic blockchain using the Proof of Work concept. While I acknowledge that Proof of Stake is a more advanced and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism, this project focuses on understanding the fundamentals of blockchain and the Proof of Work concept.

## Blockchain and Proof of Work
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that allows multiple parties to maintain a shared and immutable record of transactions. It provides transparency, security, and trust in a trustless environment.

Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm used by many blockchain networks, including Bitcoin. In PoW, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. The process of solving these puzzles requires significant computational power, ensuring that miners have invested resources (usually in the form of electricity) to participate in the network. Once a miner successfully solves the puzzle, they can append the new block to the blockchain, and other nodes in the network can verify the solution easily.

While Proof of Work has been effective in securing blockchain networks, it has drawbacks such as high energy consumption and scalability limitations. Newer consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS) aim to address these issues by replacing the computational puzzle with a selection process based on the stake (ownership) of participants in the network.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/aryajpandey/JS-Blockchain.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using npm: `npm install` 
## Usage
1. After the installation is complete, you can run the blockchain using Node.js by executing the following command in the project directory: `node blockchain.js`
2. Explore the code to understand the inner workings of the blockchain implementation in JavaScript.
